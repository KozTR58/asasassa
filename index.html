My favorite game is The Last of Us Part II.
My favorite show is Berlin.
My favorite color is yellow. (Your sister told me you like yellow. I guess I’m easily influenced.)

If you have songs you love, I’d listen to them without a second thought. It’s honestly a pleasure. Like Kali Uchis’ I Wish You Roses.
I know im a dumbass ugly nigga im sorry.
        </p>

        <h3>Why did you make this?</h3>
        <p>Because saying things straight is hard. (Because I know you hate me its fine tho like who likes a fat fuck so i can understand ur feelings dw) This felt more honest than pretending I don’t care. Also I thought it would be fun.(And kinda romantic)</p>

        <h3>FAQ</h3>
        <div class="qa"><strong>You're not my type.</strong><p>That’s fair. I don’t really try to fit into types anyway. I just show up as myself.</p></div>
        <div class="qa"><strong>I’m not into you.</strong><p>I know that. But thanks for being honest. I respect that.</p></div>
        <div class="qa"><strong>Bro you’re fat, what are you 500 lbs?</strong><p>Yeah I’m big, but I’ve got space in my heart for good vibes and good music.</p></div>
        <div class="qa"><strong>This is a bit much.</strong><p>Maybe a little. But it’s real. And I prefer real over cool.</p></div>
        <div class="qa"><strong>Why should I say yes?</strong><p>Because yes is simple.(Please im begging you.) Because I’m honest and kind. And because I’ll try.</p></div>
        <div class="qa"><strong>What if I say no?</strong><p>That’s okay. You don’t owe me anything. I’ll respect it.</p></div>
        <div class="qa"><strong>You’re doing things that actually make me uncomfortable.</strong><p>I understand, and I’m sorry for making you feel that way. For me to really know, you need to tell me directly. Otherwise, I might not realize it.</p></div>
        <div class="qa"><strong>If you’re still here…</strong><p>Well if you’re still here, maybe you could give me a  chance.(Pleaseeeee I need a chance.)</p></div>
