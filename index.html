I’m Kayra.
I play games, I overthink things, and yeah sometimes I’m a little slow. In quiet moments I find myself thinking about you sometimes.

I like music that hits for no reason.

My favorite game is The Last of Us Part II.
My favorite show is Berlin.
My favorite color is yellow.

If you have songs you love, I would honestly listen to them too. For me, that’s a pleasure. Like Kali Uchis I Wish You Roses.

This is just me. No pressure.

        <h3>Why did you make this?</h3>
        <p>Because saying things straight is hard. This felt more honest than pretending I don’t care. Also I thought it would be fun.</p>

        <h3>FAQ</h3>
        <div class="qa"><strong>You're not my type.</strong><p>That’s fair. I don’t really try to fit into types anyway. I just show up as myself.</p></div>
        <div class="qa"><strong>I’m not into you.</strong><p>I understand. Thanks for being honest. I respect that.</p></div>
        <div class="qa"><strong>Bro you’re fat, what are you 500 lbs?</strong><p>Yeah I’m big, but I’ve got space in my heart for good vibes and good music.</p></div>
        <div class="qa"><strong>This is a bit much.</strong><p>Maybe a little. But it’s real. And I prefer real over cool.</p></div>
        <div class="qa"><strong>Why should I say yes?</strong><p>Because yes is simple. Because I’m honest and kind. And because I’ll try.</p></div>
        <div class="qa"><strong>What if I say no?</strong><p>That’s okay. You don’t owe me anything. I’ll respect it.</p></div>
        <div class="qa"><strong>You’re doing things that actually make me uncomfortable.</strong><p>I understand, and I’m sorry for making you feel that way. For me to really know, you need to tell me directly. Otherwise, I might not realize it.</p></div>
        <div class="qa"><strong>If you’re still here…</strong><p>Well if you’re still here, maybe you could give me a tiny chance.</p></div>
