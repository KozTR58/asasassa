      <h2>Who is Kayra</h2>
      <p class="who">
I’m Kayra.
I play games, I overthink things, and yeah sometimes I’m a little slow. Not in a bad way, just in a very human way. I think a lot I feel a lot and I care more than I show

I like music that hits for no reason
Ezhel İmkansızım
Alexander Rybak Fairytale
Sam Aşk Her Şeyi Affeder Mi

My favorite game is The Last of Us Part II
My favorite show is Berlin
My favorite color is yellow

If you have songs you love I would honestly listen to them too For me that is a pleasure Like Kali Uchis I Wish You Roses

This is just me No pressure
      </p>

      <h3>Why did you make this</h3>
      <p>Because saying things straight is hard This felt more honest than pretending I dont care Also I thought it would be fun</p>

      <div class="faqQ">
        <strong>Youre not my type</strong>
        <p>That is fair I do not really try to fit into types anyway I just show up as myself</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faqQ">
        <strong>Im not into you</strong>
        <p>I understand Thanks for being honest I respect that</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faqQ">
        <strong>Bro youre fat what are you 500 lbs</strong>
        <p>Yeah I am big but I got space in my heart for good vibes and good music</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faqQ">
        <strong>This is a bit much</strong>
        <p>Maybe a little But it is real And I prefer real over cool</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faqQ">
        <strong>Why should I say yes</strong>
        <p>Because yes is simple Because I am honest and kind And because I will try</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faqQ">
        <strong>What if I say no</strong>
        <p>That is okay You do not owe me anything I will respect it</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faqQ">
        <strong>Youre doing things that actually make me uncomfortable</strong>
        <p>I understand and I am sorry for making you feel that way For me to really know you need to tell me directly Otherwise I might not realize it</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faqQ">
        <strong>If youre still here</strong>
        <p>Well if youre still here maybe you could give me a tiny chance</p>
      </div>
