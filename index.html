        <h2>Who is Kayra?</h2>
        <p class="who">
I’m Kayra.
I play games I overthink things and yeah sometimes I’m a little slow Not in a bad way just in a very human way I think a lot I feel a lot and I care more than I show

I like music that hits for no reason
Ezhel İmkânsızım
Alexander Rybak Fairytale
Sam Aşk Her Şeyi Affeder mi

My favorite game is The Last of Us Part II
My favorite show is Berlin
My favorite color is yellow

If you have songs you love I would honestly listen to them too For me that is a pleasure Like Kali Uchis I Wish You Roses

This is just me No pressure
        </p>

        <h3>Why did you make this</h3>
        <p>Because saying things straight is hard This felt more honest than pretending I do not care Also I thought it would be fun</p>

        <h3>FAQ</h3>

        <div class="qa">
          <strong>You are not my type.</strong>

        </div>

        <div class="qa">

        </div>

        <div class="qa">

        </div>

        <div class="qa">
          <strong>Why should I say yes</strong>

        </div>

        <div class="qa">

        </div>

        <div class="qa">
          <strong>You are doing things that actually make me uncomfortable</strong>
          <p>I understand and I am sorry for making you feel that way For me to really know you need to tell me directly Otherwise I might not realize it</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
